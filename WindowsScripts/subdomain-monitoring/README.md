Subdomain takeovers can occur through various methods and vulnerabilities. Here are some other ways a subdomain takeover might occur:

CNAME Records: Subdomain takeovers can happen when a subdomain points to a CNAME record that references an external service (e.g., Heroku, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage) that the domain owner no longer controls. If the external service account expires, the subdomain can be taken over.

Expired Services: If a subdomain was once associated with a particular service or infrastructure (e.g., a specific AWS S3 bucket or a deprecated API endpoint) and the service or resource is deleted or expires, it can be claimed by an attacker.

DNS Misconfigurations: Misconfigurations in DNS records can lead to subdomain takeovers. These misconfigurations may involve pointing a subdomain to an IP address or service that an attacker can control.

Subdomain Enumeration: Attackers may use subdomain enumeration techniques to discover subdomains of a target domain. Once they identify subdomains that do not have proper security controls, they can attempt to take over those subdomains.

Third-Party Services: Many organizations use third-party services or CDNs that provide subdomains as part of their offering. If the organization ceases to use the service or loses control over the account, the subdomains may be vulnerable to takeover.

DNS Cache Poisoning: Although less common, DNS cache poisoning attacks can temporarily redirect subdomains to malicious servers, potentially facilitating takeovers.

To defend against subdomain takeovers, consider the following best practices:

Regularly monitor your DNS records for misconfigurations and unauthorized changes.
Remove DNS records for subdomains pointing to services you no longer use.
Verify third-party services and their configurations, especially when they involve CNAME records.
Implement security headers like CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) records to control which entities can issue SSL certificates for your subdomains.
Educate your team about subdomain takeover risks and best practices.
Periodically perform security assessments and audits of your domain and subdomain configurations.
Use strong and unique passwords for accounts associated with domain management.
Implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to add an additional layer of security to your DNS records.
Detecting subdomain takeovers often requires continuous monitoring and vigilance, as attackers are always seeking new vulnerabilities and opportunities.
